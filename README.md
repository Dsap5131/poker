# Poker
Hello Reader! Welcome to my passion project of Poker! 

I am a full-time Healthcare Data Product Analyst and a part-time graduate 
student at Northeastern Unviersity pursuing a Master's degree in Bioinformatics 
with a concentration in Data Analytics. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science 
with a concentration in AI from Northeastern University. This project is a way 
for me to continue learning software development :)

This project will be updated periodically as I learn new things. The goal is 
to have this project grow throughout my lifetime so this one repository 
eventually contains all information I've ever learned.

I encourage you to create discussions, issues, or reach out to me personally
 if you see any room for improvements.

Enjoy!
